File of size 201 is created and tt is observed that both readFileSync and readFile keep the entire file in RAM, which is bad in terms of efficiency.However,
Stream uses little RAM for any file reading regardless of the size. So, as a conclusion it is best to use Stream solution for
best memory use and efficiency.
